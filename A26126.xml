            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen I at firſt drew out a Scheme of the enſuing Diſcourſe, I had the Honour of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Approbation and Encouragement to proceed upon thoſe Topicks, which cauſed me to ſequeſter the vacant hours I could ſteal from my other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, that I might employ them on theſe Meditations; which having brought to ſome perfection (and received the concurrent conſent of a great <hi>Prelate</hi> of this Realm, who gave himſelf the trouble to peruſe them, and me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to recommend them as worthy of publick view) I could not in the leaſt diſpute to whom I ſhould dedicate them; for not only your Lordſhip's condeſcenſion at firſt in adviſing, but indeed thoſe many other Obligations which your Honour hath been pleaſed to lay upon me, moſt juſtly challenge

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THis our latter Age hath ſo much degenerated from the Piety and Simplicity of the Primitive Chriſtians (which were the only marks by which they were heretofore diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the Heathen Nations) as not only not to own and live up to thoſe Principles of their Profeſſion as Chriſtians, but inſtead thereof openly and avowedly to defend Irreligion and <hi>Hobbianiſm</hi> in their Arguments, Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and Profaneneſs in their Lives, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven worſe than Heathens. To be Sober and Religious, is now adays to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe and ingentile, if not hypocritical: To be looſe and debauched, is the only modiſh thing. To be able by Sophiſms to
<pb facs="tcp:103237:4"/>baffle the Arguments of a well m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aning Chriſtian, is taken for the characteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Note of Ingenuity, and a pregnant Wit. And on the contrary, to uſe any perſwaſives to Religion and Piety, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of nothing but ſtupidity and folly. Which things conſidered, I cannot but fore-ſee what bad Entertainment this ſmall Tract is like to meet withal abroad in the World, eſpecially among thoſe who pretend to the moſt ripe Reaſon, and keeneſt Wit, whoſe cuſtom (indeed) it is to make this ill uſe of it, as to turn all ſober things into Ridicule or Railery, or elſe to diſpute themſelves out of their Duty; which they will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, when they ſuffer their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings to be ſo frequently bribed by their vicious Inclinations. There are (I muſt confeſs) many native defects in this Eſſay, and to theſe I fear will be added the ſevere Cenſure of its being altogether impertinent; at leaſt I cannot nationally expect that it ſhould be accepted by all, or (like the <hi>Manna</hi>) fit every Palate; however let it try it's fate, it will fall into the hands of ſome ſerious and pious perſons, who may probably approve the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ign, if not like the work; and I hope

            <p>The Reader may find here (I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge) many <hi>Excerpta,</hi> and if I have not done right to every Author, I deſire him to charge it wholly upon the defect of Memory, or want of inſerting the Name in my common Place Book.</p>

<note n="*" place="margin">Ubi tres Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici duo Athei.</note> hath been caſt upon thoſe of our Faculty, or whether there have been any juſt grounds for it, I know not; but this I am ſure of, that the knowledge of Second Cauſes, and our frequent Converſe with them, ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to give us the clearer apprehenſions of the Firſt, and by how much the Subject on which we continually employ our Minds and Studies, is more noble and ſublime, ſo much the more divine ought to be our Speculations; this good effect it had upon the Royal Prophet, <hi>Pſal. 139.14.</hi> Who when his Meditations
<pb facs="tcp:103237:5"/>drew him to conſider that he was fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and wonderfully made, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently breaks forth into Praiſes unto Almighty God, and Acknowledgments of his marvellous Works. Neither want we inſtances (to take off that general Infamy) of many Men truly pious in this Profeſſion. Even <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> who flouriſhed Four hundred ninety two years before Chriſt, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Title of <hi>Divine,</hi> and that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in his life, that he was <hi>Vir San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis Moribus:</hi> And to ſpeak nothing of <hi>Galen, Averroes, Avicen,</hi> and other Forreigners in this Art, in whom Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Morality hath eminently ſhined, we have lately had a more modern <hi>Hippocrates</hi> both of this Age and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who amongſt other ſweet Odours to perfume his Memory, hath this, that he was <hi>In toto Vitae ſtatu Chriſtianus.</hi> But what need I mention any more, when St. <hi>Luke</hi> himſelf was both Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian and Evangeliſt at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>If I may by this ſmall Treatiſe either ſilence the obloquies of ſome, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince others, or ſo far prevail with, or encourage any, as to lay aſide their
<pb facs="tcp:103237:5"/>unreaſonable Opinions, and betake themſelves to more religious and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect Lives; I have my aim, and ſhall think my ſelf ſufficiently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced for my weak labours: If they fail of this, I ſhall at leaſt have that ſatisfaction in my own Breaſt, that I deſigned them well.</p>

                  <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
                  <p>IT is not becauſe there have been none, or ſo few, who have buſied their Brains and Pens about this Subject of Gods Exiſtence, or that they had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged their Arguments ſo faintly, and unwieldily, as that they ſtood in need of my weak ſupport, which made me firſt enter the Liſts with the <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> and launch my ſmall Boat into this vaſt and deep Ocean: But indeed the true reaſon of it, was, that having Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated the enſuing Diſcourſe, I found my ſelf neceſſitated to lay ſuch a Foundation for it, as might prop and ſuſtain the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure, to wit, The <hi>Exiſtence of a Deity;</hi> which unleſs proved, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, the whole Fabrick muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity fall, and be buried in its own Ruins.</p>
                  <p>It is well enough known how many whole Books (not to ſay Volumes) are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:103237:10"/>diſperſed up and down the World againſt <hi>Atheiſm;</hi> beſides as if theſe were not enough, and the Controverſy ſhould ſtill remain undecided, almoſt every Sermon ſpeaks the Miniſter afraid of it: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in my judgment, it were well, if much of what hath heretofore been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of this nature, or ſpoken from the Pulpit, had proved Abortive or been ſtifled in the ſame Womb that firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced it. For in the Primitive times of Chriſtianity,
<note place="margin">

The Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> are by all acknowledged to be the moſt Ancient in the World, and though the very deſign of them were to preſcribe Doctrines and Rules for Religion, yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103237:10"/>found in them by way of proof or perſwaſion, concerning the Exiſtence of God; but it is a thing taken for granted, as being univerſally acknowledged and believed; yea even in the moſt blind and ſuperſtitious Age of <hi>Greece,</hi> when <hi>A theiſm</hi> was firſt heard of in the World, (being introduced by the Obſcene <hi>Poets,</hi> who debauched the minds of the People, to believe ſuch monſtrous things of their <hi>Gods</hi>) the Authors of it became a deriſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all intelligent Men, and were ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized with the blackeſt marks of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy; nay they baniſhed one of their <hi>Philoſophers (Diagoras)</hi> becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a Book with ſuch words as theſe, <hi>As touching the Gods, whether there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I know not,</hi> &amp;c. But alaſs! we live now in ſuch a curious and inquiſitive Age, when nothing but what is groſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be diſcovered by our Senſes, and what looks as certain as Mathematical Demonſtrations, will be received, and believed by us. We are grown as great <hi>Scepticks</hi> in Divinity, as we are in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and I am verily perſwaded that the great reaſon of it is owing to thoſe many nice Controverſies and Diſputes, which have been raiſed about it. And I cannot be induced to believe otherwiſe,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103237:11"/>but that thoſe very Arguments which have been made uſe of to confute one <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> have made twenty; for the leſs curious and examining (which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are far the greater number) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing learned perſons ſtart ſo many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and ſpend ſo much time and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in the Argumentative part to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, do from thence conclude that the thing is at leaſt dubious; and then being willing to have it ſo, that they may go on uncontroul'd in their Luxuries and Senſualities, without any further Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny will eaſily incline to believe that it is as they wiſh.
<note n="*" place="margin">Quis volumus, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile credimus.</note> But hath God left himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Witneſs? Doth not the whole Frame and <hi>Compages</hi> of the World, it's Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Conſervation, ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence his Exiſtence? And may I not ſay of this as <hi>Abraham</hi> of the Requeſt of the Rich Man? <hi>They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets,</hi> they have clear and ample Diſcoveries, both from within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and if they believe not them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they believe though Men Write and Preach never ſo much of this Nature. I eſteem it therefore much better to wave many of thoſe needleſs Diſquiſitions and Diſcourſes, which in ordinary Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103237:11"/>raiſe oftentimes more Doubts and Scruples, than they can reſolve and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie. Examples are commonly more prevalent and perſwaſive than Diſputes or Precepts; and it were to be wiſhed that we ſhould rather refute the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion of an <hi>Atheiſt</hi> by a Holy and God-like life, than by bandying ſo many nice and obſcure Queſtions, which create new Difficulties, and raiſe new Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies concerning that Holy Faith, which the pious ſimplicity of the Primitive Chriſtians received only to practice. But leſt the Arrow ſhould revert upon my own Head, and ſome ſhould too juſtly accuſe me for that which I condemn in others, I ſhall not entertain my Reader with many Arguments on this Subject (which hath already by better Heads been ſo largely and learnedly diſcuſſed) nor yet pretend to the invention of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny new, but only cull out a few which ſeem to me moſt cogent and convincing, and which have given me the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of my own Faithin the Exiſtence of a Deity.</p>

                  <p>IT was not without great Reaſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by the Wiſeſt of <hi>Kings,</hi> that when we had a mind to ſpeak any thing before God, we ſhould not be haſty to utter it; and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches us,
<note place="margin">Nunquam nos-verecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores eſſe debere, quam cum de diis agitur.</note> That we never ought to be more modeſt, than when we have to do about God: and there is no doubt but that when we ſpeak not only before <hi>God,</hi> but of him, we ought moſt ſeriouſly to weigh our thoughts and words, and with much caution produce them, leſt we ſhould any way derogate from the Purity and Excellencies of ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Majeſty. But when we have weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and conſidered all that we can of him, our Apprehenſions are very narrow and ſcant, and our Notions of him come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſhort of his Divine Perfections: For as he is Inviſible to the Eye, ſo he is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103237:12"/>Incomprehenſible to the Mind. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we conceive it is but in part: there is much more we cannot perceive nor comprehend. He is repreſented to us a Spiritual and Incorporal Eſſence, and till we come to be unbodied our ſelves, we cannot perfectly conceive what he is: ſo that we may conclude with <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi>

                  <p>Our Eyes are now too weak to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this dazling Sun, but then they ſhall be ſtrenghened and enlightned, all miſts diſpelled, and we ſhall with <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims</hi> and <hi>Seraphims</hi> admire its luſtre and bear our part to him in that Divine Anthem:

                  <p>The greateſt Phyſical certainty that it

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103237:17"/>Exiſtence. But when I ſeriouſly conſider, and am aſſured that there is a <hi>God,</hi> and that his chiefeſt Attribute is <hi>Truth,</hi> (which hath a direct Repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to <hi>Deception</hi> and <hi>Error</hi>) and that He will not, cannot therefore impoſe upon, and delude my Senſes: Hence is it, that I infer the reality of them, and thence conclude, that all things that are truly repreſented to my Senſes, are indeed ſo as they are repreſented; becauſe God never obtrudes Falſities upon us, under the pretext of Truth: Neither doth it at all invalidate this Argument, to aſſert that we are often deceived, becauſe that the Deception proceeds not from the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but from our Will, when we too raſhly conſent to things not clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſtinctly underſtood. Therefore all <hi>Mathematical Truths</hi> are not to be ſuſpected, and the <hi>Exiſtence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> no more, (nay leſs) to be doubted of than them.</p>
                  <p>Next of all, it is plain and obvious, even to the loweſt Capacity, yea known by the dim light of Nature, that what at firſt had a beginning, did not derive its being from it ſelf, but that there muſt be ſome ſuper-intended Cauſe, on which (in reſpect of their Subſtance)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103237:18"/>all other things do depend, and which muſt have in it the Complement of all Perfections; and that can be no leſs than a Ray of <hi>Divinity,</hi> or rather <hi>God himſelf.</hi>

                  <p>All the <hi>Pulchritude</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of an <hi>Effect,</hi> ought to be contained in the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> (for the <hi>Cauſe</hi> cannot give that to the <hi>Effect,</hi> which it ſelf enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not) wherefore all the Perfection of living Creatures ought to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in that <hi>Cauſe.</hi>

                  <p>In like manner how doth the vaſt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Earth anſwer the wonderful ends of its Creation?

                  <p>On this Spot of Earth are high Hills, which ſerve to curb the violence of the Winds, to bound Kingdoms and Places; to furniſh Stones for Buildings: to be a Refuge for the wild Beaſts; and to ſtand as ſo many Bulwarks to defend us from our Enemies.

It is true, that Man bearing on his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, the Soul, the Stamp and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of his Maker, hath ever been ſo great a Favourite in Heaven's Court, as to have the greateſt Bleſſings and Dignities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon him; but certainly there is not the moſt abject Creature, nor life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Plant, nor deſpiſed Mineral, but challenge a ſhare in his Care and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: Nay I may in ſome ſenſe aver, that there may be more of Gods care ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the Conſervation of the <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of a ſmall Inſect or Animal, than in thoſe greater Works of Nature; for by how much the more weak and puny any thing is, ſo much the more Care and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry is requir'd to its preſervation: 'Tis not the Magnitude of the Piece that commends the Artificer; there was more Art ſhewn in the ſmall Fly of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio montanus,</hi> than in the Mold of his great bodied Eagle: There is more Skill, Chymiſtry and Mathematicks, in one ſingle Bee, than in the whole Republick of Elephants and Dromedaries.

                  <p>Our next Aſſertion is, That thoſe <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary Things</hi> are not Diſpoſed or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by any Thing elſe, but <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> or (if you will) by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Hand of God. There are two O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions which ſeem to invalidate the Strength of this Poſition; The firſt is that of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> who endeavour to exclude this <hi>Providence of God;</hi> ſaying, <hi>That God doth Govern Heavenly Things by Himſelf, but all Sub-caeleſtial Bodies by the inevitable Influences of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets.</hi> The next is that of <hi>Epicurus</hi> and his Followers; Scil. <hi>That all things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by the Fortuitous Concourſe of Atoms, or by Chance.</hi>

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:103237:27"/>
                  <p>As to the former, That the <hi>Starry Influences</hi> do not inevitably and fatally determine things, is evident, ſince even they themſelves are guided and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an Over-ruling Hand, according to that of the Poet;
<q>Aſtra regunt Homines, ſed Deus Aſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regit.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                  <p>So that what is in the Power of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cannot be ſaid to be <hi>Sui Juris,</hi> and can only act Secondarily as a Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate or Subſtitute to the Supream; and what is done muſt be only by a Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, not Coactive Power. Thus indeed may thoſe Heavenly Bodies diſpoſe and incline, not in the leaſt force and conſtrain: Sometimes, as in the Civil Government of a Nation, the Supreme Power, or King, acts by his inferiour Deputies and Magiſtrates; and what is done by them, is ſaid to be done by the King himſelf, becauſe done by his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103237:27"/>or Command; ſo here the great <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator,</hi> God Himſelf, may make uſe of thoſe Planetary Bodies (as his <hi>Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates</hi>) to exert ſome particular Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon Sublunary and Elementary Things: (For as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves, <hi>Deus regit inferiora per ſuperiora.)</hi> But yet they are ſtill accountable to their firſt <hi>Law-giver,</hi> and cannot tranſgreſs, or go beyond thoſe Limits ſet unto them. It is confeſſed that <hi>Second Cauſes</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, but it is only in ſubordination to God, who is the Firſt: and thoſe who look no higher than the Influence of the Sun, Configuration of the Stars, the Changes of the Moon, and the like, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve nothing but diſappointment. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, I think it will be no difficult matter to ſhew that the Planets cannot have that Power and Influence as is pretended; for if you conſider that wild Rapid Motion of the Heavens, which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> aſcribes to them, which is many thouſand times ſwifter than a Bullet ſhot out of a Gun; can we rationally ſuppoſe but that it muſt needs alter the Reſpects of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, not only every moment, but (if it were poſſible to conceive) every hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth part of a Thought next, it might be thus argued; If theſe had any ſuch
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103237:28"/>Influence upon Terreſtrial Bodies, a thouſand years ſince, now they have not, nor can have the ſame, according to our acception. The Conſequence ſeems va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid enough, if you conſider that <hi>Aries, Taw us, Gemini,</hi> and the reſt, by their periodical and private Motions (from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt</hi>) have now changed their places by thirty Degrees, and cannot have the ſame Poſitions and Aſpects as formerly; for <hi>Aries</hi> is gotten into the place of <hi>Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Taurus</hi> into the place of <hi>Gemini,</hi> and <hi>Gemini</hi> into the place of <hi>Cancer;</hi> and yet we ſtill take our Calculations as before: and what we take for <hi>Aries,</hi> is indeed <hi>Piſces,</hi> and what we take for <hi>Piſces,</hi> is <hi>Aquarius,</hi> and ſo on. To theſe give me leave to add, that for the moſt part, thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations made by the moſt exact <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers,</hi> are found to be very deceivable and falſe; and if at any time they do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thus and much more ridiculous and phantaſtical is it to imagine all Things in the World to be made by meer Chance, which if ſo, I would demand, How it comes to paſs, that we do not daily ſee the Production of New, and (never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeen) Things?

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103237:39"/>thoſe Laws at firſt ſet them, or aſſume new Qualities, until he who is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable, ceaſe to be ſo. The <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> and <hi>Sena</hi> will continually purge: The Emetick Preparations of <hi>Antimony,</hi> will alwaies Vomit, and the fleſh and parts of Animals well conſtituted (if they meet with a fit ſubject) will never ceaſe to nouriſh and reſtore: And theſe hath God by his infinite Power and Wiſdom, made and deſtin'd as the proper and adaequate Inſtrument to thoſe very Ends from all Eternity: Thus we ordinarily find that all Medicines well prepared, and exhibited by a Skilful hand, which underſtands not onely the Nature of the Medicine but the Patient's Diſeaſe, never fail of their deſigned effect. It is recorded in Sacred Writ, that ſeveral Cures have been wrought by our Saviour, his Apoſtles, and Prophets, which though in one ſenſe they have been mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous (becauſe the end hath very far exceeded the ſtrength of the means) yet we rarely find any without Application to Natural Means. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were bitten with fiery Serpents in the Wilderneſs, God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to erect a Brazen Serpent for their Cure: <hi>Num.</hi> 21.8. But although the Divine
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103237:40"/>Will had annex'd a power of healing unto that Serpent inſtrumentally, yet the ſame Will appointed the actual applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that power to the looking upon that Serpent: <hi>Every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, ſhall live.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God could have cured <hi>Hezekiah</hi> by a word, but he muſt apply a Lump of Figs to the Boil, before it ſhall be effected; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.21. <hi>Naaman</hi> muſt (by command from the Prophet) waſh (not in the Rivers of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> but) in <hi>Jordan,</hi> before he can be healed of his Leproſie; 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.10. although he could have done it by the very Touch of his Hand: Nay our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, makes Clay with his Spittle for the Blind-Mans eyes: <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.6, 7. And he muſt afterwards waſh in <hi>Siloam.</hi> He laid his hands alſo upon ſome and healed them. So that it is very manifeſt that God Almighty doth not ſeparate the Means from the End, but makes the former a neceſſary preparative to the latter; otherwiſe he ſhould always do Miracles (for Miracles are nothing elſe but the Works of God, without, and againſt the ordinary Means) but he worketh by ſucceeding all lawful Means with his Bleſſing. This may ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn two ſorts of perſons.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, It reproveth thoſe that think a fatal and indiſpenſable neceſſity of Events, and ſo neglect the uſe of Means proper for their Health or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>

                  <p>It is the firſt Aphoriſm of our Divine <hi>Hypocrates, Vita brevis, Ars longa, Occaſio momentoſa, Empirica periclitatio periculoſa, Judicium difficile,</hi> &amp;c. That our life is but ſhort, that the Art of Phyſick (by reaſon of the difficulty and multitude of things that are to be known, and the Judgment and Experience that is required, which takes up ſo much time) is very long; that there are certain Golden Seaſons or Opportunities to be laid hold of, which are of ſo great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that being once laps'd, are irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and ſo the Diſeaſe does <hi>in deterius vergere,</hi> ſtill grow worſe, if not incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: That Experience, and Empiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Remedies, are dangerouſly deceitful and deceitfully dangerous, producing for the moſt part (eſpecially in Acute Diſtempers) nothing leſs than the utter deſtruction of the Souls Manſion place, and the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt; and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103237:41"/>that (by reaſon of the difference of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, Climates, Complications, Accidents, and the like) any certain judgment is very difficult to be made; yet how obvious is it to find every where unlearned and unexperienced Men, confuting <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amaſs'd a few Receipts, commence <hi>Doctors</hi> in a moment, and daringly venture on thoſe things, which a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt knowing Phyſician would tremble at.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103237:42"/>harmleſs things, which if they did no good would do no hurt; for here is no <hi>Medium</hi> in this, <hi>Et qui morbo non occurrit aegroto manus infert.</hi> He that lets the time lapſe in which the Diſtemper might have been removed by a Skilful hand, or ſo confounds it that it is now become quite other than at firſt, and ſo renders it Incurable, does as much in effect as give him <hi>Sublimate,</hi> or <hi>Arſenick,</hi> and though it may not kill as ſodain, it will as ſure: <hi>Imperitia Medicorum dolo comparatur</hi> (ſay the Civilians.) Ignorance in a Phyſician is a kind of Cheat, and a Bloody cheat too; for what does the Ignorant Phyſician, but <hi>Negotiari animas hominum</hi> (as old <hi>Cato</hi> in <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith) Trade and deceive Men out of their lives, when they repoſe moſt truſt in them.

Chriſtianity does (I am ſure) though Ambition, Policy, or Gain may not, oblige every Man to his own province and buſineſs; yet there is a generation of Men, that extreamly buſie themſelves in other Mens matters, and ſleep in their own; which flie to every mark that is ſet up, but that which their Calling and Religion directs them to aim at; that will thruſt their Sickles into other Mens Harveſts, and let their own rot at home: Theſe things are very ſinful and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corous: Let every Man fill his own place, and then he will have little leaſure to thruſt himſelf into another mans:

                  <p>There is a ſecond ſort of people who deſerve reprehenſion, that think a fatal and indiſpenſible neceſſity of events, and ſo wilfully neglect the means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for their health and recovery.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain that nothing comes to paſs contrary to the divine will, or permiſſion, and that the period of every mans life is fix'd in reſpect of the divine preſcience; yet for us to jmagine that therefore, when a Sickneſs invades us, we ought not to make uſe of means, ſaying with the Vulgar, If I ſhall die, I ſhall die with them, and if I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, I ſhall recover without them; is very abſurd and irrational: for firſt of all, Whether the life of a Man be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by an abſolute, and inconditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Decree, is much controverted; and that many Mens lives have been length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and preſerv'd by God's bleſſing on proper Remedies, applid by Skilfull
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:103237:43"/>Phyſicians, is moſt evidently evinced by continual Experiences: And on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that many have been forcibly hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to their untimely graves, by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the hands of unskilful Empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, is too notorious: Inſtead of many I will give you one Inſtance in both. Not twice three years ſince, a Boat too much pack'd with Souldiers (all of them of an Athletick temper) was paſſing a River, and ſunk with them a little off the ſhore, where moſt of them periſhed; but within a ſhort time, by the diligence and help of ſome Spectators, ſeveral of their bodies were taken up, and laid upon the ſhore, which were equally Cadaverous; an Eminent Phyſician, paſſing by, and moved with compaſſion, bleeded ſome of them, and preſcrib'd ſuch Medicines as he thought proper to their condition; which it pleaſed God to ſucceed with his benediction: ſo that thoſe, and thoſe only recovered which were thus handled, the others ſuffering the common (though untimely) fate of all Mankind: So that hence it ſeems manifeſt that tho God had prepared the means, yet had there not been an actual application of it, they muſt of neceſſity have ſhared in the ſame deſtiny.</p>

                  <p>The other is this, which I my ſelf have been more than once the ſad beholder of, that perſons labouring under a troubleſom Cough or Catarrh, which hath diſturb'd their reſt at nights, and being of a thin texture of Body, and weak Conſtitution, by the unſeaſonable, and unskilfull adminiſtration of Opiatick Medicines, have taken their <hi>laethaean</hi> nap, and gone ſmoothly and quietly to the Land of forgetfulneſs. The like may be ſaid of giving the ſame Medicine, in a <hi>Pthyſis, Pleuriſie, Empyema,</hi> and the like, which hath often produced the ſame effect. To ſay nothing of thoſe many ſtrong robuſt men, that meerly through wantonneſs, or for prevention of ſome Epidemical and Popular Diſeaſe, that hath then threatn'd, have committed themſelves to the hands of confident Empiricks, who not regarding, or not knowing the temper of their Patients Bodies, and the Nature and Doſe of their Medicines, have been by a <hi>Hypercatharſis</hi> (or too violent Evacuations) ſent head long to the other World; which may ſufficiently evince, that many have ſhortned their daies, by raſhly expoſing themſelves to ſuch dangers, or elſe wilfully neglecting thoſe aſſiſtances they might have had for

                  <p>The common Objection of <hi>Aſa's</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion for ſeeking to the <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and not to the Lord, is a very weak one, to draw this Concluſion from, That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ought not to apply my ſelf to a Phyſician: for it is evident by the text 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.12. that here is no <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titheſis,</hi> or oppoſition, but a <hi>Protimeſis,</hi> and is an Expreſſion by way of choice and eſtimation: <hi>Aſa</hi> is reproved becauſe that in his Diſeaſe he ſought not to the Lord, but rather to the Phyſicians, or them onely: Had he implored the divine as well as humane aſſiſtance, he had not (without doubt) been reprehended for it. So in the 16 of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> the 19. and 20. verſes, we are bid not to lay up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for our ſelves vpon Earth, but lay up for our ſelves treaſures in Heaven; and in a Parallel place, we are forbad to labour after the Meat that periſheth, but to labour after that which endureth to everlaſting Life; which are not to be underſtood as plain prohibitions to lay up Earthly treaſures, or to labour for our daily food, but by way of choice or <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103237:45"/>labour after that Meat which endureth to everlaſting Life, than that which periſheth; which is no more than this, have a greater care of the one than the other: Our Saviour himſelf ſays, <hi>They that are whole need not the Phyſician, but</hi> (as it follows) <hi>they that are ſick;</hi> which is a ſufficient warrant for all in that Condition to apply themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: for he is, as <hi>Herophilus</hi> obſerves, <hi>Manus Dei,</hi> the hand by which God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys health unto their diſeaſed Bodies: And though he can (as I have before ſhewed) cure them by a miracle, yet his uſual and common way, is by fit and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate means; ſo that they who wilfully neglect them, do <hi>ſihi manus inferre,</hi> even cruelly prove their own Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners: therefore as the Son of <hi>Syrach, Eccleſ.</hi> 38.4. obſerves, that ſeeing God hath created Medicines out of the earth, he that is wiſe will not abhor them.</p>
                  <p>I could here ſwell this Section to a great bulk, if I deſigned, to depaint the dignity of Phyſick, and learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, but the Sun needs not the light of a Candle to make it ſeen, nor a perfect natural Complection the diſgraceful help of ſuch Artificial Tinctures; beſides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame Profeſſion my ſelf, I

                  <p>Laſtly, A Holy and Vertuous life, is a neceſſary qualification for a Phyſician, in order to his good ſucceſs in Practice, and that whether you reſpect the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs it ſelf, or the prevalency of his Prayers, for the benefit of thoſe he is concern'd for.</p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, the Royal Prophet had by his long Experience obſerv'd, and after his Obſervation declares (in his firſt Pſalm and third verſe) concerning the pious and good Man, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he doth it ſhall proſper; that thoſe ourward things, which are not of the Eſſence of true Felicity, but yet are as advantageous Acceſſions and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments thereof, ſhall in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner be preſerved to the pious
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103237:47"/>Man, he having the promiſe of the life that now is, and that which is to come; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. All his Productions of all ſorts, his Thoughts, his Reſolutions, his Studies, his Actions, and all where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is concern'd, ſhall by Gods ſpecial Bleſſing and Providence be exceedingly proſperous and ſucceſsful to him: In a word, he ſhall be bleſſed in all that he ſetteth his hand unto. Then again it is neceſſary if you regard the prevailency of his Prayers for the benefit of thoſe for whom he is concerned; St. <hi>James</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.16. That we ſhould pray one for another, that we may be healed; and tells us that the Prayer of Faith ſhall ſave the Sick, and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up: It was <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi>'s Prayer that procured the length'ning of his days for Fifteen Years; <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 38.5. and we know not what efficacy the Prayers of holy and good Phyſicians may have for the procuring Gods Bleſſing on their Endeavours, if not for the protraction of the lives of their Patients: I ſhall not give much credit to the many extravagant Stories of the many admirable Cures wrought by the Prayers of the Religious Votaries of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but yet this
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103237:48"/>I may confidently believe, which St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>James</hi> the 5.16. <hi>The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual fervent Prayer of a Righteous Man, availeth much;</hi> and that too without any limitation, not only for himſelf, but others alſo. The Son of <hi>Syrach</hi> ſays, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 38.14. That the Phyſicians ſhall pray alſo unto the Lord, that he would proſper that which they give for Eaſe and Remedy to prolong Life; and if our Prayers be Fer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>nt and our Perſons Righteous, which are the conditions to make our Prayers accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and prevalent; St. <hi>John</hi> will tell us, We ſhall not fail of having our Requeſts <hi>granted;</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.22. But that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ask of him, we ſhall obtain: and the Blind Man in the Goſpel, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood well enough what he ſaid, <hi>Now we know that God heareth not Sinners, but if any man be a Worſhipper, and doth his will, him he heareth:</hi> Joh. 9.31.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have ſeen that Sanctity of Life in a Phyſician is a neceſſary Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in order to make him ſucceſsful in his Practice; and therefore it were to be wiſhed that they that take upon them that honourable Title, would lead ſuch holy and good lives, as might adorn their Profeſſion, and not Vicious

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:103237:49"/>affrouted by vain-glorious and impious Phyſicians, who proudly arrogate all the praiſe and glory to themſelves. But if it pleaſe God that if their Patients die or miſcarry, then to be ſure God ſhall be ſaid to have a hand in their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſaying, God deny'd his Bleſſing: It was his will to have it ſo, and we could not oppoſe it. Thus they Worſhip God, as the <hi>Greeks</hi> did <hi>Hercules,</hi> by Railing, and <hi>Mercury</hi> by throwing Stones at him: But let all ſuch conſider that God is a jealous God, and his Glory he will not give to another. It is he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone who at firſt gave all things their being, and he expects not only that they ſhould be all owned as the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of his own hands, but alſo to receive Glory by them: It was he that created the Phyſician (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 38.1.) and that (in compaſſion of our Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) endowed the Earth with ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Medicinal Things for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Reſtitution of Diſeaſed Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and that we finding the Sanative Qualities and Effects of them, might thereby be drawn to the deeper admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Goodneſs, and return him by way of acknowledgment, the eaſie Tribute of our moſt due Praiſes.

                  <p>It is of his pleaſure and goodneſs that we our ſelves enjoy our health and beings, and of his great mercy that we can be any way Inſtrumental to convey the one, or preſerve the other, to any perſon; let us not be therefore ſo unreaſonable and ungrateful to defaulk from God what is his due, and of right pertains to him; but as his is the Work, ſo let him have the glory. Moreover, neither doth this only correſpond with Divinity, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prudence; for ſince it is in the power of God, to bleſs or fruſtrate our proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to proſper or blaſt the operation of our Medicines (<hi>For</hi> it is <hi>he</hi> that <hi>maketh ſore, and bindeth up; he woundeth, and his hands make whole:</hi> Job. 5.18.) we cannot rationally imagine but that he will do better when he ſees

                  <p n="1">1. Having premiſed that a Phyſician ought to live a Holy and Vertuous Life, let him in the firſt place when any ſick perſon deſires his aſſiſtance, caſt himſelf on his knees, or if the ſuddainneſs or multitude of buſineſs, or want of privacy, interrupts, he may ſupply it by ſilent Ejaculation, and moſt humbly implore the great Phpſician to inſtruct his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and bleſs his Undertakings, for whatever the Second Cauſe be God is the Firſt, and therefore the Divine preſence and aſſiſtance is abſolutely neceſſary, and firſt to be invoked in all weighty affairs, (and what greater than thoſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Lives of Men) <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="2">2. Neither muſt we reſt here, but muſt joyn our Studies and Endeavours to our Prayers, and after we have fully inform'd our ſelves of our Patients con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and throughly examin'd all Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, carefully and adviſedly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them, abſtaining from trying any new Experiments or extreme Remedies, except in extreme and deſperate Diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or where they are very conſentane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Rules of Phyſick, and highly probable to anſwer thoſe deſigns, which

                  <p n="3">3. That we do not peremptorily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a Cure in uncertain and dangerous Diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>It is too well known how many Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians there are, who are ſo Dogmatical in their Opinions, confident of their own Abilities and Succeſs of their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, that they will not ſtick even in the moſt difficult Caſes, at firſt ſight, to warrant a perfect Cure: by which, at laſt when they find themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated in their hopes, and their prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks deceive them, they expoſe their Judgments, and many times forfeit their Repute: And it were well, if this were all, but alaſs the conſequence is far more dangerous! for by this means the Patient is careleſs of putting his Houſe in order, and (which is worſe) of trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and preparing his Soul for Death.</p>
                  <p>The beſt Chriſtians, altho they live in an habitual holineſs and conſtant preparation for their end, and like the Wiſe Virgins have Oyl in their Lamps,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:103237:52"/>in expectation when the Bride-groom will come, yet they would willingly then yet once more dreſs their Wedding Garments, and trim their Lamps, by Repetition of Acts of Repentance, Faith, Hope, Devotion, Patience, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Reſignation of themſelves to God. And who is there, who when he is ready to breath his laſt, thinks ſo well of his Condition, that he would not pray <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer? <hi>O ſpare me a little, that I may recover my Strength, before I go hence, and be no more ſeen.</hi> Or cry out with <hi>Criſorius</hi> in <hi>Gregory, Iuduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as vel uſ<expan>

But I fear the far greater number of thoſe we are concern'd for, are ſuch as need not only trimming, but Oyl in their Lamps too; not only the Ornaments, but the Garment it ſelf; and then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly when there is time for it, and God may in mercy accept of a Death-bed Repentance, how much have we to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for, either for flattering them with the hopes of Recovery, or not acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with their approaching dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>I know the common Objection to this, is, that by incouraging the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:103237:52"/>his languſhing Spirits are upheld, he more readily ſubmits to the uſe of means, and bears his Sickneſs with a greater cheerfulneſs; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, by telling him the truth, his Spirits are dejected, he becomes impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and rejects the Preſcription. To theſe it is eaſily anſwered, that either the Patient is a Religious good Man, or a Vicious and Wicked Man. If the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer he loves not to be flattered, but will certainly have the better eſteem of his Phyſician, for dealing ſo plainly with him; and becauſe he thinks the time of his deliverance from his preſent Pains and Sickneſs, and inauguration into a State of everlaſting Joy and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs, ſo near approaches, his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits inſtead of being dejected, are exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and becauſe he knows that his time is in Gods hand, that neither he nor the Phyſician can infallibly know the time of his departure, and that God hath commanded the uſe of means; he is content to ſubmit to the Rules pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd him, and leave the ſucceſs to God.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, If he be a Vicious and Wicked Man, it is but fit that if more gentle and mild perſwaſions will
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103237:53"/>not prevail, that he ſhould be fright'ned into a ſenſe of his deſperate condition, and not ſuffer'd to go like an Oxe to the ſlaughter, to his eternal perdition, without ſome Monition and Advice, which for ought we know, being giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en prudently and in ſeaſon, may with the Operation of Gods Spirit concurring, work ſo good an effect upon him, as to draw him to a true (tho late) Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and then he hath pull'd him out of the Fire, as a Fire-brand ready to be conſumed, and ſaved a Soul from Death; as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.20. and then let any one tell me if this be not a ſufficient recompence for his pains, and amongſt all ſober and prudent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſalve enough for his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It may be farther urged that Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are only to take care of the Body and the Divine of the Soul: It is true, for that purpoſe they were conſulted, and it were to be wiſhed the Divine might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgotten, but acquainted early with the Diſeaſed's Caſe, and earneſtly in treated to viſit the Patient as well as the Phyſician; but yet I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Phyſician hath many bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opportunities than he can have, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:103237:53"/>which is much to be lamented, he is ſeldom ſo early or ſo often adviſed with as the Phyſician; and though the later be not ſo much obliged by his Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the former, yet certainly even he cannot be excuſed in point of Charity.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Caution or Advice, is, That if it ſhall pleaſe God to make us ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in our Endeavours, we do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the praiſe of it (as is too common) unto our ſelves, but unto God; to whom alone it is due.</p>
                  <p>I have in the former part of this Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhew'd the reaſonableneſs of it, and therefore all I ſhall add by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, ſhall be this; That this is the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:103237:58"/>beſt of all, moſt pure, moſt holy, and moſt full of Piety: and he adviſes, that when we worſhip them, it ſhould be always with a ſincere honeſt Heart, and undefiled Tongue.</p>
                  <p>There are many ways by which <hi>God</hi> may be worſhipped, but that which I only intend to mention here, is by Prayer and Invocation, which I ſhall not curiouſly diſſect neither into its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious parts; but only tell you, that this being a part of Gods Worſhip, thoſe that own his Exiſtence, and their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him, are indiſpenſably oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay him that ſo eaſie Tribute and Adoration.</p>
                  <p>Prayer is the great duty, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt priviledge of a Chriſtian: By it we have intercourſe with Heaven, and bear a part with Angels, and beautifi'd Spirits. It is the <hi>Medium</hi> by which we diſcover all our wants and neceſſities un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: the Key to unlock Heaven, and draw down all Bleſſings ſpiritual and temporal upon us. <hi>Is any Man Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted? let him Pray. Doth any Man lack Wiſdom?

<pb facs="tcp:103237:58"/>as well as our priviledg and duty, let us not be wanting to our ſelves in it.</p>
                  <p>You will find in the following Sheets, a ſmall Manual of <hi>Directions</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,</hi> which (as by the homelineſs of the dreſs, you may eaſily ſee) were compoſed only for my own <hi>private uſe</hi> and <hi>addreſſes,</hi> and never intended that <hi>they</hi> ſhould as much as peep out of my <hi>Cloſet door.</hi> And now I ſhall not tell you (as many do) that they were preſs'd out, or extorted from me by <hi>importunity</hi> of <hi>Friends,</hi> or the like; but indeed (after a little pauſe and conſideration with my ſelf) they came out voluntarily; hoping at leaſt they may have ſome good influence on ſome or other, either for Direction, or Encouragment to a <hi>Holy Life;</hi> and if not, they will only remain uſeleſs to others, as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in my <hi>Cloſet;</hi> and yet however I ſhall have this ſatisfaction in my own Conſcience, that I intended them well, and I hope the <hi>purity</hi> of the <hi>Intention,</hi> will ſome way ſanctifie the <hi>Action,</hi> and procure <hi>Acceptance</hi> if not with <hi>Men,</hi> yet with <hi>God.</hi>

                  <p>I am very ſenſible of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and unparallell'd compoſure of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> for all publick
<pb facs="tcp:103237:59"/>and <hi>moſt</hi> private concerns; and how the deficiency of this as to particular wants (if any ſuch be) is ſupplied by the incomparable Authors of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man, Practice of Piety, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Private Devotions, Devout Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> by <hi>Biſhop Taylor,</hi> and many other worthy and <hi>pious Perſons,</hi> whoſe Shoes I am not worthy to bear (out of ſome of which you will find ſeveral <hi>Collections</hi> in the following pages.) But yet give me leave to eaſt in my Mite too, and take in good part my weak endeavours alſo, which probably in ſome things may be more particular than what you meet in them: Neither dare I (being a Laick) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them as Forms for others, but only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint my <hi>Reader</hi> that they are ſuch as I uſe my ſelf, and may perhaps be beneficial to him upon the like occaſions. Theſe I know are very defective too, and as he grows more prolifick in Grace, ſo he will be able to ſupply my defects by a new Addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own: And if theſe may give any ſuch encouragment, or have any good effect upon any one, I have my aim, and ſhall think my ſelf well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced for my Studies <hi>Hic Rhodus, Hic ſaitus.</hi>

                     <p>FAſting in its Definition, I take to be nothing elſe but an abſtaining from our lawful Food, upon a Religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; which although it be no where in Scripture injoyn'd ſimply for its own ſake, yet if we conſider the many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of it, in order to the benefit of our Souls, we ſhall not think the Commands of the Church and the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Primitive Chriſtians too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere and inimitable.</p>
                     <p>The Jews faſted twice every Week, <hi>ſc.</hi> Tueſdays and Thurſdays, concerning which is the boaſt of the <hi>Phariſee, Luke,</hi> 18.12. and the Chriſtians have not come behind them, and the Sabbath being for good Reaſons altered, they have obſerved Wedneſdays and Fridays for a Religious Faſt; which days are taken notice of by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and called <hi>Dies Stationarii.</hi> But alas, we that now live in this profligate and degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Age, are ſo far from following the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103237:69"/>ſteps of pious Antiquity, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of our Holy Mother, the Church, that if we ſet apart a Day for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, once in (a quarter ſhall I ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacrament, or (a year rather, we think we have ſufficiently deny'd our ſelves; and diſcharg'd our Duty! But certainly did we ſeriouſly conſider, and put a due eſtimate upon the great Emoluments and Advantages of this Holy exerciſe, we ſhould not be ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs and negligent in it; which I ſhall in the next place give you a taſte of.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. And firſt of all, Faſting is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental to all Acts of Devotion, for ſeeing there is ſo near an affinity between the Soul and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the former uſing the Organs of the latter for its Operations, and for the moſt part follows the Temperament of it, it cannot be when the Body is ſtuff'd even to Satiety, and clog'd with a Load of indigeſted Humours, that the Soul ſhould be ſo active and vigorous as at other times, and mount with thoſe Wings of Devotion, with that Zeal and Affection towards Heaven, as when it is freed from that Burthen, which ſtill preſſes it down to the Earth: And if there were no other reaſon to be given
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103237:69"/>for it, every good Chriſtian's own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will ſufficiently evince the Truth of the Aſſertion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faſting is very inſtrumental in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our humilation for Sins paſt, and ſubduing of Luſts for the future.</p>
                     <p>Such is the miſery of Mankind, That whilſt we are driven by an indiſpenſable neceſſity to Eating and Drinking, that we may ſupport our frail Beings, we alſo by the ſame Act cheriſh and foment our Vices. Our Fleſh is apt to be too rebellious, and we find a Law in our Members conſtantly warring againſt the Law of our Minds, and leading us Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive at will: Now faſting is the Soul's Phyſick, and there is no better way to tame this Monſtrous Panther, than by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting that <hi>Pabulum</hi> which nouriſhes and feeds it. This courſe Holy <hi>David</hi> took, he wept and chaſtened himſelf with Faſting, and many of God's Children imitate his Example; and no doubt when it is performed with good ends and deſigns, as it is an act of Auſterity and holy Revenge upon our Selves, ſo by God's Mercy it will procure that Mortification, that we aim'd at by it, and we ſhall find either the Temptation removed, or God impowering us from
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103237:70"/>on High with Grace ſufficient to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is very profitable and inſtrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for the removing or prevention of Judgments, and that either parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular upon thy Self, Family, or Friends, or National. <hi>Ahab</hi> though a wicked King, yet becauſe he faſted and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf before God, tho poſitive Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were denounced againſt him, he receives a Suſpenſion of them in his days; 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.27, and 29. and tho <hi>David</hi> found not that effect when he faſted for the Child, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.16. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Sin was notorious and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and God would have the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as publick to; yet it is manifeſt that <hi>David</hi> expected it, and thought that the readieſt way to attain it.</p>
                     <p>The Heathen <hi>Ninevites</hi> ſucceeded in their Faſt for the removal of a general Judgment upon the whole City, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.5. they proclaimed a Faſt, and in the tenth verſe you have the good ſucceſs of it, God repented of the evil that he had ſaid he would do unto them, and he did it not.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, Faſting is very ſeaſonable, when we have any extraordinary thing to beg of God.</p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:103237:70"/>
                     <p>I do not give much Credit to the many Stories amongſt the Romiſh Credentials, and what great things have been done by Prayer and Faſting, but we have a much ſurer Word of Propheſie: we know what the effect of <hi>Heſter</hi>'s Faſt was, <hi>Eſther.</hi> 4.16. how ſhe obtained her requeſt for the deliverance of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We know that when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> were to be ordained <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> there was Faſting as well as Prayer premiſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. Therefore if we have any Internal Mercy or Grace to deſire of God, or if we have any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary External Bleſſing to implore at his Hands, let us unto our Prayer joyn Faſting alſo.</p>
                     <p>One Emolument more I will (by way of ſurpluſage) ſubjoyn, which probably with ſome ſort of perſons may be more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive than all the reſt, and that is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it upon the Score of Health.</p>
                     <p>In moſt Conſtitutions, when the Stomach does (as it were) keep Holy day, and is not charg'd with a new load, or taken up with the concocting of new Food, it hath time to digeſt Crude and Superflous Humours, which oppreſs it, and ſo after Concoction either mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly evacuates, or inſenſibly diſſipates
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103237:71"/>them; ſo that <hi>that</hi> which could not be before digeſted by a full Stomach, is now effectually performed by an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty one. All the ways and paſſages of the body are by this means rendred open and ready for Excluſion. Faſting power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully opens Obſtructions, makes Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration more Free and Eaſie, and the Mind and all the Senſes more chearful, quick and vegate. Faſting is not onely the Phyſick of the Soul, but the Body too: Many Diſeaſes have been by this prevented, many cured. Hence that of <hi>Fernelius: Quos igitor morbos inedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It will be impoſſible for me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to every one, how often they ought to faſt: Every Man's piety, and his neceſſary occaſions muſt inſtruct him in the frequency of this Duty. From thoſe who labour, and are bound in the Sweat of their Brows to procure a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency for themſelves and their poor Family, little of this Duty is expected. However ſeeing they ought to ſeparate ſome time before the receiving of the

But for thoſe who are not under ſuch indiſpenſible neceſſities, and have any tolerable leiſure, their Piety cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly may well prompt them to ſet apart one Day every Week for Faſting, Calling themſelves to an Account of their Sins, Humiliation and Prayers unto God for Pardon, Preventing or Strength'ning Grace.</p>
                     <p>It is Obſerved even in the outward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this World, that thoſe who keep the cloſeſt Accounts, thrive beſt; and though there be a Day-Book (as they call it) in which they ſet down the Deben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of every Day, yet once in a Week (at leaſt) theſe are all ſumm'd up, and put into a better Form in the great Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, that they mey be found and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view'd upon all occaſions: Thus ought the Spiritual Merchant do likewiſe; though he examines himſelf every day for the Sins thereof, yet he ought to have other particular days to look them over again; that ſo having a few of them altogether, it may make him more humble, more penitent.</p>
                     <p>If thou therefore art a Man of leiſure,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103237:72"/>and God hath wrought in thy Heart to ſet apart one Day in a Week, thus to humble thy ſelf before him, to be reconciled to, and to be at peace with him, and thy own Conſcience, thou haſt thy liberty to chooſe which Day of the Week thou wilt for this purpoſe: only give me leave to inform thee, That it hath been the Practiſe of the Primitive Chriſtians (and that not without ſome reaſon) and it is the Command of our Church too, to ſet a part Friday for that purpoſe, as being the Day of our Bleſſed Saviour's Crucifixion; which was thus long obſerv'd by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans after his Paſſion. Others chooſe rather <hi>Saturday</hi> for that Action, which was likewiſe kept as a Faſt by the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who bewailed our Saviours abſence, he now lying in the Grave. And others obſerve the ſame day, becauſe it may ſerve as a preparation to the Lords Day, which may be beſt ſanctified, when ſome Preparatory Religious Acts have gone before, caſting off the Cares and Thoughts of the World before-hand, that they may attend upon the Lord without diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Either of theſe I judge convenient enough, neither do I think it neceſſary
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103237:72"/>to bind you to either of them; Prudence and your own occaſions muſt preſcribe to you in this: However this is my Cuſtom, I always deſign <hi>Fryday</hi> for my Faſting day, becauſe if by any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of Friends, or Company, or accidential Buſineſs, I am then hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from my Deſign, I may have the benefit of another Day; <hi>i. e.</hi> Saturday, to perform my Devotions in.</p>
                     <p>You may alſo perhaps ſee cauſe to ſet apart a particular day (or days) in a year to humble your ſelf for any great or capital Sin that day committed; or to praiſe God for any great mercy or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance that day received.</p>

                     <p>This being done, you are next to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view your Sins again, and conſider what were the occaſions which drew you into each particular Sin; and then conſider and think of thoſe ways and mean,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103237:83"/>by which you may for the future avoid them; and arm your ſelf before-hand with reaſons and holy reſolutions againſt their aſſaults, whenſoever they invade: which you may do well to commit to Writing.

                     <p>An Examplification of this you have in one or two Sins following: As,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>January</hi>— I faſted, and upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, I found my ſelf guilty of unclean and unchaſt thoughts (and that with delight and approbation) which ſometimes brake forth into corrupt, frothy Diſcourſe, and immodeſt or unclean Actions. Upon reflecting into the Cauſes of this Sin, I found them to be, Eating and Drinking too highly, keeping light or idle Company; not keeping that Guard over my ſelf as I ought, nor beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving my ſelf in all places with that gravity and ſeriouſneſs as I ſhould: and giving way to the firſt motions of vain and impure thoughts. Upon which I reſolved to uſe my ſelf to a ſpare low Diet, to avoid
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103237:83"/>Drinking much Wine or Strong Liquors, to avoid light Company, and not ſuffer mine ears to hear, or my tongue to utter any frothy or corrupt Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to carry my ſelf always with a becoming gravity, in my behaviour: to deport my ſelf as in the immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, remembering that he is a God of infinite Purity and Holineſs. I will be watchful over my own Heart that I do not permit any unclean thoughts or fancies to enter within me, much leſs give them Entertainment; and as ſoon as they offer themſelves to my fancy, I will endeavour to divert them by holy and heavenly Meditations. And laſt of all, I will be frequent in my prayers to God for a clean heart and purity of ſpirit, and for the Graces of Temperance and Chaſtity.</p>
                     <p>When I faſted, likewiſe I found my ſelf guilty of muth deadneſs and dulneſs in my Devotions, vain and wandring thoughts in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Upon Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my ſelf I found the great Cauſes of it, to be the want of keeping my ſelf continually in a ſerious frame and temper of ſpirit: my not ſpending ſome ſome time in Meditation before I came to pray; my want of frequency in my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103237:84"/>and want of the due ſenſe of God's great and dreadful Majeſty, and my own neceſſities of thoſe things I come to pray for. Upon which I reſolved conſtantly to keep my ſelf in an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual frame and temper of piety, to be more frequent in Prayer; and to prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditate of the dread and awfulneſs of that Majeſty before whom I appear: to conſider before-hand that nothing but what is hearty, and from the ground of the Soul, will be accepted by him, and how great need I have of thoſe things I ask. I will pray often for the Spirit of Devotion, and Sincerity, and will be ſure to watch over my thoughts, when I am at my Devotions; but if any ſuch enter, I will preſently repel them, and then pray with greater fervency, to croſs the Devil's deſign therein. Theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and reſolutions being over, you may begin again thus:</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>And in Jeſus Chriſt thy only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the holy
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103237:84"/>Ghoſt, born of the Virgin Mary, ſuffered under</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>was crucified dead and buried. He deſcended into Hell.

O Let no perſon by impenitence and wilful Sin forfeit his part in it, but by the power of thy Grace bring all, even the moſt obſtinate ſinners, to repentance. Inlighten all that ſit in Darkneſs, all Jews, Turks, Infidels and Hereticks, take from them all blindneſs, hardneſs of heart, and contempt of thy Word,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103237:87"/>and ſo fetch them home, bleſſed Lord, unto thy Fold, that they may be ſaved among the number of the true Iſraelites.

O bleſſed Lord how long ſhall Chriſtendom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the vileſt part of the World, a ſink of all thoſe abominable pollutions, which even Barbarians deteſt? O let not our profeſſion and our practice be always at ſo wide a diſtance. Let not the diſciples of the holy and immaculate Jeſus be of all others the moſt profane and impure. Let not the Subjects of the Prince of Peace be of all others the moſt contentious and bloody, but make us Chriſtians in deed, as well as in Name, that we may walk worthy of that holy vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherewith we are called, and may all with one mind and one mouth glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thee the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.

Be not wroth very ſore, O Lord, neither remember iniquity for ever; but though our backſlidings are many, and we have grievouſly rebelled, yet according to all thy goodneſs, let thy anger and thy fury be turned away, and cauſe thy Face ſtill to ſhine upon thy Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which is in danger to be deſolate, for the Lord's Sake: do thou compoſe our differences, heal the wounds which our unhappy ſchiſms and diviſions have made in thy Church, and make up the breaches of our <hi>Sion;</hi> and ſo ſeparate between us and our ſins, that they may no longer ſeparate between us and our God. Avert thoſe heavy judgments, which we either fear or feel, and our ſins cry aloud to Heaven for, and deny us not the continuance of thoſe mercies which we yet enjoy, and are altogether unworthy of; but whatever temporal mercies thou art pleas'd to deny us, whatever temporal judgments thou art pleaſed to bring upon us, O remove not thy Candle-ſtick from us, nor quench the light of our <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but, bleſſed Lord, be pleaſed ſtill to continue unto us the liberty of thy Houſe, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103237:95"/>been, beſides we ſhould think ſuch Sins never ſufficiently bewailed and repented of, and poſſibly too our memory may be too willingly treacherous, we may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get them, or at leaſt the aggravating Circumſtances of them: we deſire God indeed not to remember them, but then we our ſelves muſt and ought.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The committing of our Sins to ſuch an Accomptal, makes us preſently to remember when God ſends any Judgment upon us, for what particular Sin it is.</p>
                     <p>Puniſhment is the natural effect and conſequence of Sin: God many a times ſpares when we deſerve puniſhment, but he never puniſhes us without our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits; yea God many times doth ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapt the puniſhment to the ſin, that we may very intelligibly read the one in the other; and then we ſhall have this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit, that underſtanding the Cauſe, we may haſten to the Cure, confeſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail the ſame, kiſs his Rod, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Juſtice of his proceedings, and ſay, Righteous art thou, O Lord, and juſt are thy Judgments: This affliction is but the genuine product of my Sin, I may thank my ſelf for it, and therefore <hi>I will bear the Indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him;</hi> the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103237:95"/>Cup is bitter, but ſalutary. God chaſtens me here, that he may ſatisfie his Juſtice, and ſpare me hereafter: And ſo the Sin repented of, the removal of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſoon follows, ſeeing it hath anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that end for which it was ſent.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The keeping our ſins in memory hath this great benefit in it, to teach us how to arm our ſelves againſt the ſame ſins for the time to come. If we have been once foiled by an Adverſary, it is ten to one but (if we have adverted to it) we may eaſily remember what it was that gave him the advantage over us, and ſo like <hi>Alfrid</hi> ſtrongly prepare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the next Aſſault: <hi>Si modo victus erat ad craſtina bella parabat.</hi> It will be no difficult matter, having an account of your ſin, and the circumſtances of it, to re-collect alſo what inducements and temptations prevailed againſt you; at what avenue the ſin entred, and ſo thou mayſt immediately guard and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thy ſelf, that thou do not twice fall by the ſame Stratagem.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is profitable that you may ſee what ſtrength you have got over them, and know how to keep your ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them. Though an Enemy be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times repulſed, yet if he be ſtill

A fifth Reaſon is, That we may fruſtrate the Devils great Deſign and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, which is either to make them appear ſmall in our Eyes when they are indeed very great, or elſe to hide them altogether from us until the Judgment of the great Day.</p>
                     <p>No ſin is indeed poſitively ſmall, being committed againſt a God of infinite pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and holineſs, but comparatively ſo, with relation to other ſins; but yet the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103237:96"/>Devil is ſuch an Impoſtor, that he would needs perſwade us, that even great ſins are no ſins at all, or very ſmall ones, peccadillo's; and tells us as <hi>Lot</hi> of <hi>Zoar,</hi> Is it not a little one? 'Tis but a ſmall inconſiderable Luſt, a humane Frailty, this will not ruin thy Soul, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are guilty of far greater than this. Thus he will endeavour to hood-wink thee for the preſent, but then at the hour of Death, or day of Judgment, he will take off this Vail, and open thine Eyes, when to thine aſtoniſhing amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou wilt find how miſerably, how irremediably thou haſt been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                     <p>The conſtant ſight of thy ſins will be apt to raiſe thy thankfulneſs to God, for being delivered from the power of them. Sin is the greateſt Evil, and if we once come to be ſenſible of it, we ſhall not only fly from it, but have our hearts enlarged with the greateſt thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to God for our delivery from the power and dominion of it.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The keeping of ſuch a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, is very profitable, that by reflex thoughts on our ſins, we may be kept in the greater humility and low opinion of our ſelves. We have generally in our
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103237:97"/>Natures an inbred Principle of Pride, which puffs us up with a vain conceit of our ſelves, and more eſpecially in reſpect of Grace, with which being but ſlender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbued, we are preſently opinionated of our ſelves, undervalue others, and think that we have arrived to the very <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>And as it will be fit for thee to keep by thee a Catalogue of thy Sins, ſo I judge it will be no leſs profitable alſo to preſerve a Catalogue of any extrordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Mercies that God hath vouchſafed to thee in the whole courſe of thy Life, whether Spiritual or Temporal: And here ſeeing Gods Mercies are like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, infinite, it will be impoſſible for me to ſet down any definite number of them; and therefore I ſhall leave it to every particular perſon to make his own Collection and Obſervation.</p>
                     <p>But certainly the Spiritual Advantages will be very great, to intermix the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Gods Mercies, with the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103237:101"/>remembrance of his own Sins; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at ſuch a time of Humiliation: it will conduce much to the augmenting of his ſorrow and contrition for ſin: for when the pious Soul ſhall thus reaſon with himſelf: <hi>Lord I have daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked thee to diſpleaſure by my ſinful and wicked Life, though thou haſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me day by day with thy Mercies. I have crucified my Bleſſed Saviour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, and put him to an open ſhame, though he thought it not too much to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſuch great things, and at laſt to die for me, to reſcue me from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Damnation. I have grieved thy holy Spirit by my frequent Oppoſitions of his bleſſed Motions, who would have led me to Repentance, and hath often courted and invited me to it; and when I have run wilfully into Sin, O what earneſt ſolicitations hath he made unto me to forbear? Thus and thus, O Lord, haſt thou done for me, but yet what unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy returns have I made for all this love of thine? O my Soul! canſt thou think of this without remorſe? Canſt thou forbear condemning thy ſelf, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying God? And to ſay, Thou, O Lord, art Righteous, but I am Vile and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; thy ways are upright and equal, but
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103237:101"/>mine very crooked and unequal: thou haſt not dealt with me after my Sins, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded me according to my Iniquities.</hi> This was the Method that God himſelf took with <hi>David</hi> to work him to a true Compunction of Spirit, after he had been guilty of <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Murder,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7, 8. where you have God reckoning up the Mercies he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd on <hi>David; I anointed thee King over</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and I delivered thee out of the hand of</hi> Saul, <hi>and I gave thee thy Maſters Houſe, and thy Maſters Wives into thy Boſome, and gave thee the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>and of</hi> Judah; <hi>and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee ſuch and ſuch things;</hi> which in the 13. <hi>v.</hi> made him with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of heart confeſs that he had <hi>ſinned.</hi> So in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6. <hi>Is not he thy Father that hath bought thee? hath not he made thee, and eſtabliſhed thee?

When you are dreſſed retire to your Cloſet, and keep a ſtrict guard over your thoughts, that you ſuffer nothing (if poſſible) of any Worldly thing to enter there, but meditate that you are to keep this day in the bleſſed memory of your Lord and Saviour's Reſurrection, and of the great goodneſs of God in vouchſafing you the liberty of another Sabbath day, the continuance of his Word and Ordinances; whereas there are many thouſands which yet ſit in Darkneſs and the Shadow of Death: And therefore reſolve with thy ſelf to ſpend it intirely to his Glory, and in his Service; and that not only in general

The ſuddenneſs and ſurprize of an evil adds to the weight and ſmart of it. <hi>Death we are told is an enemy,</hi> 1 Corinth. 15.26. and (you know) to be ſurprized by an Enemy puts all into tumult and confuſion, and permits not the free uſe of that reaſon and conduct that we ſhould otherwiſe have had upon a timely monition and preparation: Nay we are told that it is the laſt enemy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fight but this one battle, it will be the greateſt imprudence in the World not to muſter up all our forces, not to make all the proviſion we can before-hand, that we be not worſted in this laſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict: <hi>Non licet in bello his peccare:</hi> To fail once here is to fail for ever: And we ſhall never have any opportunity more to rectify a former fault.

If a ſharp Sickneſs ſeizes our Bodies whilſt we have a load of guilt upon our Souls, what conſternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and terrour does it ſtrike unto us?

                     <head>Remedies againſt ſome particular Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Devil in the time of Sickneſs.</head>
                     <p>THe Devil is ſo deluſory and ſubtil a Spirit, that like the cunning An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gler he loves to fiſh in Troubled Waters, and takes all Advantages of our weakneſſes and diſturbances of mind to inſnare us; and then moſt ſtrongly aſſails us when we have the leaſt power to reſiſt him: There was a time when Satan did ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend his Tyranny, ſit cloſe in the heart
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103237:119"/>feeding on thoſe luſts he found there, without any outward ſhew of violence; <hi>(Certa quiſcendi tempora fata dabant.)</hi> But now he awakes as a Lion out of ſleep, and as a young Lion greedy of his prey, ready to tear the poor Languiſhing Soul in pieces, calls in all his powers and artifices, becauſe he knows that he hath but a ſhort time, and if he miſs this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity he muſt then let it alone for ever. Therefore it will be very neceſſary that you pre-arme your ſelf againſt his Objections or Aſſailings; and they may be ſuch as theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Firſt, He may aſſail thee by ſetting before thee the multitude and hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thy Sins, that they are ſo many and ſo great that thou canſt not expect that God ſhould pardon them, and ſo endeavour to draw thee to a deſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God's mercy. But then preſently oppoſe this Temptation of his by calling to Mind the multitude and infinitneſs of God's mercies, which cannot be out-numbred by our Sins, nor out-weighed by our moſt preſumptuous tranſgreſſions. Remember that place of <hi>Micah.</hi> 7 and 18. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth iniquity, and paſſeth by the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of thine heritage? Who retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103237:120"/>not his anger for ever, becauſe he delighteth in mercy:</hi> and that other in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Though your Sins were as Scarlet, they ſhall be white as Snow; though they be Red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wooll.</hi> Conſider alſo that the greateſt Sinners repenting have found Mercy, as <hi>Manaſſes, Mary Magdelen, Peter, Paul,</hi> yea the Thief on the Croſs, who at the laſt breath found mercy.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Devil may in the time of thy Sickneſs aſſail thee by ſetting before thee the Strictneſs and Severity of God's Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and tell thee, It is true God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful indeed, but he is juſt too; <hi>Zephan.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92, 15. <hi>And he will not let the Wicked go unpuniſhed; his juſtice runs parallel with his mercy; and as the one is infinite, ſo is the other too.</hi> To this oppoſe Chriſt's full and compleat Satisfaction: Indeed by the Law no Man could be juſtified, but Chriſt was made a Curſe for us that he might redeem us from the Curſe of the Law. That he might receive the Adoption of Sons, <hi>Gala.</hi> 3.13. Chriſt by one Oblation of himſelf once offered, made a full, perfect, and ſufficient Sacrifice, Oblation, and Satisfaction for the Sins of the whole
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103237:120"/>World. Chriſt himſelf will anſwer for thee: Theſe are mine, and ſhall be made up with my Jewels, for their tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was I ſtricken and cut off from the Earth, for them was I bruiſed and put to grief; my Soul was made an offering for their Sins, and I bare their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; they are my ſeed, and the travel of my Soul: I have healed them by my Stripes, I have juſtified them by my Knowledge; they are my ſheep, who ſhall take them out of my hands?</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Satan</hi> may object that thou haſt no part in theſe promiſes, becauſe thou art not elected. To this oppoſe God's free Covenant; all are invited to receive mercy, God excludes none but ſuch as exclude themſelves: <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth come ye to the Waters, and drink, is the Language of God by the Prophet:</hi> Iſa. 55.1. Nay our bleſſed Saviour confirms it alſo, <hi>John.</hi> 7.37. <hi>If any</hi> (excluding none) <hi>Man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink:</hi> and again in the 55. of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous Man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
                        <pb n="124" facs="tcp:103237:121"/>And ſo in the 33. of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the Wicked; but that the Wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your, evil way, for why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> And therefore if thou be one that hath turned from thy evil ways, never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute thy election, but as ſure as God lives, and that his Oath and Word are Truth, ſo ſure ſhalt thou live with him in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting bliſs and happineſs; and therefore here thou may'ſt call to mind ſome of the fruits of thy Faith that thou haſt at any time found in the Courſe of thy Life, and thence comfort thy drooping Soul; concluding that thou art certainly of the number of thoſe that are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Salvation.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Fourthly, The Devil may perhaps endeavour to perſwade thy Soul that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art as it were in ſome kind of deſertion, and wanteſt that clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which formerly thou hadſt, by reaſon of Gods preſent dealings with thee, that God is not thy God, that thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned Sins cauſeth him now to hide his Face from thee in thy greateſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, and that he will no more be intreated by thee.</p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:103237:121"/>
                     <p>Indeed if thou haſt not repented of thy Sins, the Devil's argument is good; but if thou haſt, the Teſtimony of thy Conſcience, that thou haſt truly repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all thy ſins, and that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity, thou haſt had thy converſation in this life; never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, but aſſure thy ſelf, that though God ſeems to hide himſelf from thee, yet he has no other deſign in it but to try thee, and the ſtrength of thy Faith, thy Chriſtian courage and reſolution: This will be but for a ſhort time, and then the ſweetneſs of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn will abundantly compenſate for his ſhort with-drawing: <hi>For a ſmall moment</hi> (ſaith God) Iſa. 54.7. <hi>have I forſaken thee, but with great Mercies will I gather thee. Job</hi> had ſufficient confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the return of God's favour and mercy, though for the preſent there was no manifeſt appearance of it, but lay under the greateſt preſſure of affliction that a poor mortal could bear; and was adviſed, becauſe God had forſaken him, to curſe God and die; and therefore with a generous and noble Spirit reſolves that <hi>though he kill him yet will he truſt in him,</hi> Job. 13.15. Holy David's faith and courrage was no leſs, when he could
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:103237:122"/>confidently ſay, <hi>though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death yet will I fear none evil;</hi> Pſalm. 23.4. I have read of a Martyr that during the time of his Impriſonment, being under ſome trouble of Mind, had often beſought God for ſome irradiations of his Love and Favour, and that he would ſend him the Comforter, but could receive nothing of it, but rather more diſquiet and anxiety of mind, but yet he was reſolved to wait God's leiſure, which he did; and when he was faſtened to the Stake, he cries out with a heart too full of joy to expreſs it in larger terms: He is come: He is come. I ſhall conclude this with the words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ch. 50.10. <hi>Though a Man walk in darkneſs and ſee no light, yet may he truſt in the Lord, and lean upon his God.</hi>

                     <p>Reading is like the Manducation or Chewing of our Food, and Meditation as the Concoction of it: and if both theſe go before, there is no doubt of a good and ſalutary Reflection to follow; and as one affords wholſome laudible Chyle for the nouriſhment of the Body, ſo will the other give forth ſtrength and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Refreſhment for the Soul.

                     <p>Meditation, I take to be a ſerious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation or Conſideration of any Divine or Spiritual Subject, and a particular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it to our ſelves, ſo as to work upon, and raiſe our Affections.</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103237:123"/>the Affections and all the Powers of the Soul. Of it there are two ſorts, the one ſet and deliberate, the other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal or ſudden. Both theſe have a large Field to walk in, and are as unconfined as the Matter and Subjects of them are; but principally the former is taken up in Contemplation of the Love, Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice, and other Attributes of God: in Conſideration of the great and miraculous Love of Jeſus Chriſt in his Incarnation, miſerable (yet ſenſeleſs) Life, bitter Death, Reſurrection, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, continual Interceſſion, and all the benefits of our Redemption; of the Miſeries of Life, the Certainty of Death, and Uncertainty of the Time of it; the glory of Gods Saints; the dreadfulneſs of Judgment, the Terrors of Hell: Or elſe in Meditating of any part of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The latter is only converſant about ſudden and occaſional things, whereby the buſie active Soul makes particular Applications and Reflections, according as the Subject or Occaſion offers it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The benefits of both theſe are very great. <hi>Meditatio quaſi mentis ditatio.</hi> Meditation is an inriching of the Soul. By this means you have a ſufficient Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

                     <p>This work is of all others the moſt ſpiritual and ſublime, and therefore the perſon moſt fit for this Heavenly Employ is the moſt holy, moſt heavenly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.

                     <p>Being then retired at a convenient time to this ſolitary place, which thou chooſeſt for thy Meditation, endeavour in the firſt place to disband all vain and worldly thoughts, and to work up thy Soul to a due frame and temper of ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; to help which, thou may'ſt uſe this or the like ſhort Prayer.</p>

                        <head>Of the Mercy of God.</head>
                        <p>MErcy in God is an Attribute Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to his Nature, by which he pitieth thoſe that are in Miſery, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth thoſe that are in Neceſſity, and paſſeth by many ſins and frailties in his Creatures, which he might in Juſtice ſeverely puniſh.</p>
                        <p>Mercy and Miſery are relatives, and were there no Want nor Treſpaſs, there needed no Mercy.</p>
                        <p>Mercy is either in the Affection or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: In the Affection it is termed Bowels of Mercy: in the Expreſſion, Works of Mercy.</p>
                        <p>The former God always hath; for it is one of his principal Attributes, and cannot be ſeparated from him, no not at the time when he is in the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Juſtice; for when his hand ſtrikes, his heart (as I may ſo ſpeak) melts and pities, and his Bowels yearn within him; like a merciful Judge who at the ſame time (being compell'd by
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:103237:130"/>juſtice) that he condemns the Criminal, relents in his heart for him. In the very midſt of Judgment God remembers Mercy.</p>
                        <p>The latter, every Man living hath daily freſh Experiences of in the plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Largeſſes of his undeſerved Bounty. That thou yet liveſt, is an unparallell'd Mercy; for thou mighteſt have been now in Hell, beyond the Hopes of any more Mercy, as well as many thouſands who perhaps have deſerved it leſs than thy ſelf.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It is of the Lords Mercy that we are not conſumed;</hi> Lam. 3.22. Should I go about to enumerate the variety of Gods Mercies towards us as Men, and as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, I might in the next page recount (what the Philoſopher fooliſhly attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) the ſands of the Sea-ſhore, or the drops of the Ocean. Gods Mercies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, as they are undeſerved, ſo they are free; he hath no other motive than what proceeds from his own goodneſs and pleaſure; <hi>He hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy:</hi> Rom. 9.18.</p>
                        <p>Alaſs, there is nothing in us that could invite his Mercy, but our own miſery and wretchedneſs: he pitied us
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:103237:131"/>when we lay in our blood, and ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, live.</p>
                        <p>God's mercy is univerſal, illimitable: <hi>His mercy is over all his Works;</hi> Pſalm. 145.9. The wicked as well as the godly daily taſte of his mercies; <hi>for he ſendeth Rain upon the juſt, and the unjuſt;</hi> Matt. 5.45. but yet his Mercy is more ſpecial to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Elect Servants: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. for thoſe he hath mercies, tender mercies; yea multitudes of tender mercies: <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51.1.</p>
                        <p>God is great in mercy, Pſalm. 119.156. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.14. <hi>He is rich in Mercy:</hi> Eph. 2.4.</p>
                        <p>The duration and conſtancy of God's mercy, it is for everlaſting; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100. <hi>ul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

There is no perfection in God the Acts of which are more manifeſt, than in that of his Mercy: Let us Conſider it's oppoſite,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103237:131"/>Juſtice: How few Acts can we find of this, for multitudes of his mercies? And when he does ſmite, how many warnings doth he give before-hand? How long is he whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Sword, and lifting up his hand to ſtrike? He ſeems even to lay aſide his Omniſciency, that he might be fruſtrated in doing this work, <hi>This his ſtrange Work:</hi> Iſaiah 28.21. <hi>I will go down</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>and ſee if their wickedneſs be altogether ſo great as the Cry which is come up unto me: and if not, I will know:</hi> Geneſ. 18.21. <hi>God delighteth in mercy:</hi> Micah. 7.18. But it grieves him to the very heart (if I may ſo ſpeak) when he is forced to execute his Juſtice. <hi>Dolet Deus quoties cogitur eſſe Deus.</hi> Who is there that can ſay he hath been puniſhed according to his demerits? Nay, canſt thou find out any Act of his Juſtice which hath not an Alloy or Mixture of his Mercy? <hi>for his tender mercies are over all his Works.</hi> Pſal. 145.9.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Learn then hence, O my Soul, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and adore this infinite perfection of Almighty God, and to labour after a due Senſe and Conſideration of it, that rhou mayſt glorifie him for it.</p>

                           <hi>Praiſe the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me praiſe his Holy Name: Praiſe the Lord, O my Soul, and forget not all his benefits.</hi>

                        <p n="3">3. And is God ſo merciful? Then this, O my Soul, ſhould teach thee humility, and to have low thoughts of thy ſelf.

                        <p>In a word, We ſhall enjoy more than ever we could deſire or wiſh.

                        <p>And as the conſideration of the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Torments of the Wicked to all Eternity, gives them their greateſt venom and malignity; ſo on the other ſide the conſideration of the continuance of thoſe Joys to all Eternity, adds unto them their greateſt Beauty and Perfection;

                        <p>For as nothing enters into that holy place that defileth, ſo there is nothing there that can defile.

The World is conſumed, and no Temptation can come thence; or if we could come to it, thoſe pleaſures now would have no guſts or reliſh. The Fleſh cannot tempt us, for that is now refined and purifi'd from all Corruptions and vain Deſires; we are now ſo confirmed in our State of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that God himſelf (with reverence do I ſpeak it) cannot alter or change it to all Eternity.</p>

                        <p>THere is not a more powerful Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to reclaim a Sinner from the wickedneſs of his ways, or to incourage a holy man in the proſecution of Piety and Goodneſs, than the frequent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Death. When a wicked Man ſhall ſeriouſly conſider, That though he now gives himſelf the full ſwing and liberty of his unlawful pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and denies himſelf nothing that his depraved Appetite can crave or ſuggeſt unto him; yet theſe are but fleeting and momentany: That <hi>when a few years are come, he</hi> ſhall be taken from them, <hi>and go the way whence he ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn;</hi> this will certainly imbitter his
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103237:156"/>falſe joys, and lay ſome reſtraint upon him in the Career of all his Senſual De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. On the other ſide, when a good and holy Man ſhall conſider, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the ways of Vertue and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he meets with many ſtraits and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, he hath many fears and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles within, many trials and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without, yet theſe will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long; <hi>when a few years are come,</hi> he ſhall be free'd from them all: <hi>he ſhall go the way, whence he ſhall not return.</hi> This certainly will encourage him to perſevere, and to continue faithful unto Death.</p>
                        <p>This was that which afforded holy <hi>Job</hi> ſo much comfort in the midſt of all his Afflictions: He was in a very miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition, under the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than's Malice, full of noiſome Boils and grievous Pains; laughed at, and mocked by his cruel Enemies; nay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached and contemned by his neareſt Friends (as you may ſee a Catalogue of his Sufferings, from verſe the ninth to the 17th) yet he ſtill maintains his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity with the conſiderations of the ſhortneſs of his life, and conſequently of the duration of his afflictions; ſaying, <hi>When a few years are come, then I ſhall
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:103237:156"/>go the way whence I ſhall not return:</hi> from the words we may collect</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The certainty of Death: <hi>When a few years are come, then I ſhall go the way,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The uncertainty of the time of it, <hi>When a few years are come.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet leaves it in indefinite, he doth not ſay, Such a number of years, or in ſuch a year I ſhall die, but, <hi>when a few years are come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The brevity of Mans Life: Thought he mentions years, yet they are but few: <hi>When a few years,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The certainty of Death: St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>That it is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Men once to die,</hi> and this Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Decree of Heaven is like that of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> irreverſible; had Man continued in his primitive Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, he ſhould not indeed have died; but when once Man put off that white Robe, he became immediately obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto Death; and God tells him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Duſt thou art, and to Duſt ſhalt thou return. The wages of ſin is Death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As certainly as we live, ſo certainly ſhall we die. Neither the Majeſty of the Prince, nor the meanneſs of the Peaſant:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103237:157"/>the Wealth of the rich Man, nor the Poverty of the Poor: The ſtrength of the Mighty, nor the holineſs of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, can exempt from Death; ſo that I may take up that Interrogation of the Prophet, <hi>What Man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee Death?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. The uncertainty of the time of it. <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> by Calculating Nativities, have pretended to foretell the Deaths of others as well as themſelves, but have ſeldom ever hit right in either, and have been miſerably deceived. Our times are in God's hand: This is one of the <hi>Arcana Imperis,</hi> thoſe incommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive prerogatives God keeps to himſelf, and dare any Mortal be ſo bold as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it. God hath ſaid that he comes as a thief in the Night, and hath bid us Watch: <hi>That of the hour and the ſeaſon knoweth no Man;</hi> and yet ſhall we ſay that we have any certainty of his coming. Do we not ſee how many are daily ſnatch'd away by a ſudden and untimely Death? And yet ſhall we boaſt our ſelves of too morrow? Infancy, Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Youth, Manhood and Ripeneſs of years, can no more plead Exemption from Death, than old Age; ſo that you ſee how uncertain the time of it is.</p>
                        <pb n="193" facs="tcp:103237:157"/>
                        <p n="3">3. The brevity of Mans Life. <hi>David</hi> obſerved that the days of our Age are Threeſcore years and ten, and at moſt but fourſcore, and if we wade through many thouſand Accidents, and at laſt arrive to that Age, it is ſtill but ſhort with reſpect to Eternity, and we ſpend our years as a Tale that is told, ſcarcely remembring when or where we began. But it is not one of many thouſands, whoſe Lamp burn thus long to its low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Baſis, but either the Oyl is conſumed, or a puff of wind hath blown it out long before. <hi>What is our life,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James? It is even a vapour that continueth but a little while, and then vaniſheth away. David</hi> compares it to <hi>ſleep,</hi> which laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but for a Night; to <hi>Graſs,</hi> which in the Morning is green and groweth up, but in the Evening is cut down, dried up, and withered. <hi>Lucian</hi> calls it a <hi>Bubble,</hi> which by the next breath of wind va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth into Air. <hi>Homer a Leaf,</hi> which if it be not gathered by the hand, or eaten by a Worm, or forced by the wind, will wither and fall of its own accord at <hi>Autumn. Pindar, the Dream of a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow;</hi> what more vain, unconſtant, ſhort liv'd things than theſe? Yet ſuch is the Life of Man. Well then might <hi>Job</hi> ſay,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:103237:158"/>
                           <hi>When a few years are come, then I ſhall go the way whence I ſhall not return.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From the words we may gather theſe four Corollaries or Obſervations.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. From the Example of this holy Man, I learn that we ought to think of Death before it comes. <hi>When a few years are come, then I ſhall go the way,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That we ought not only to think of Death in general, but of our own Death in particular: <hi>I ſhall go the way, whence I ſhall not return.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. That it is the higheſt piece of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to prepare for it before it comes, becauſe that after Death we ſhall not be able to return, to amend or rectifie the deficiency of our former preparations; <hi>I ſhall go the way whence I ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4ly. and Laſtly, That to a pious and innocent Soul, the conſideration of Death and never returning again to a troubleſome and ſinful Life, is matter of great joy and comfort. <hi>When a few years are come, then I ſhall go the way whence I ſhall not return.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, That we ought (from the Example of holy <hi>Job</hi>) to think of Death before it comes. There is nothing
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:103237:158"/>ſo much diſcompoſes a Man, or unfits him for the due Exerciſe of his Reaſon and Prudence, in the conduct of any weighty Affair, as to be ſurprized ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and without his expectation. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a ſudden and profuſe joy, as well as an immoderate and unlook'd for grief, hath cut off the thred of the lives of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: What diſorder and diſcompoſure then, will a ſudden Arreſt from Death, make in the heart of that Man, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as much as thought on, or looked for it before hand? How will it amaze or diſtract him? And turn all his Senſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Confuſion? If a Man had only one thing of great moment to do in his whole Life, upon the ſucceſs of which depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either his happineſs or miſery; we ſhould count him certainly the moſt ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid and careleſs Fool, that ſhould not as much as think and conſider of it, and contrive all ways poſſible before hand, how he might ſucceed in it: You have ſeen already that Death is certain, and upon our dying depends our Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, or Eternal Damnation; how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible muſt we then be, if we are not often in the time of our life and health, taken up with ſome ſerious thoughts, and contemplations of it?</p>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:103237:159"/>
                        <p n="2">2. That we ought not only to think of Death in general, but of our own death in particular: <hi>I ſhall go the way whence I shall not return.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Death is a general term, and if it touch not us or our Family, our Friends, or Relations, we are as unconcern'd as to hear of a Sickneſs or Mortality beyond the Seas, in which we are like to be no fellow ſufferers or ſharers. We can read every Week the Bills of Mortality, and hear of this and the other great Perſon dead; nay we can take many turns in the Church and Yard, and walk over the Graves of our deceaſed Friends, and yet be as unmoved and unſenſible of our own change, as the Stones we walk upon: But Alaſs! Do we think that our ſelves alone are Immortal? That we on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhall have an Exemption from Death? Shall not the Paſſing Bell at length Toll for us, and ſhall it not at length be ſaid in the Streets, That ſuch a one is dead? Yes certainly, when a few years (perhaps weeks or days) are come, then thou in particular ſhalt go the way whence thou ſhalt not return. O then think of Death before it comes, and of thy own death in particular; ſay thus within thy ſelf, I am now in a ſtate of health and ſtrength,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103237:159"/>I have now time and opportunity for Repentance, my Lamp is yet burning, I am invited to the Marriage of the Bride, and the Door is yet open; now my Tears will be accepted, now my Prayers will be heard; now is the acceptable tme, now is the day of Salvation: Now or never muſt I prepare for Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, now or never muſt I make my peace with God: What madneſs, what folly, will it be in me to hazzard my Eternal Salvation upon the hopes of a long life? Or upon the poſſibility of having time to repent on my Death-bed.</p>
                        <p>Our time you ſee is uncertain, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny there are who are taken away by a ſudden death, even in the midſt of their ſins: Why may not I be one of thoſe? Many that thought as little of it as I do, and had as good Reſolutions as I have, have yet periſhed to all Eternity. Others there have been, who though they have had timely Warnings of their Death by a lingring and tedious Diſeaſe, yet ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their pains and uneaſineſs have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed them for Repentance and fitting themſelves for their change; or elſe God hath then in Juſtice denied them the grace of Repentance, who have been ſo long time neglective of it. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:103237:160"/>is the gift of God, and he that hath promiſed pardon to the Penitent whenſoever he repents, hath not always promiſed to give the Sinner Repentance. And if God ſhould thus deal with me (as he may juſtly do) even then deny me Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance (without which I cannot be ſaved) when I call upon him for it,
<note place="margin">Qui promiſit paeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenti veniam, non pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſitpeccanti paeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam.</note> becauſe I refuſe to do it now, when he calls upon me; how miſerable and deplorable will my condition be? Can I endure the Wrath of a Sin-reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God? Can I dwell with everlaſting Burnings? Can any thing ſcreen me from thoſe direful Torments, prepared for the Devil and his Angels; but now I to have my ſhare in them! O remember what God ſays, <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out minn hand, and no Man regarded; but ye have ſet at nought my counſels, and would none of my reproof; I alſo will laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

O then let it be now thy care, as it is thy prudence and intereſt, ſo to prepare in life, that thou may'ſt receive comfort in death; that thy accounts may be fair, no error or deficicncy in them, and thou may'ſt be able to give them up with joy and not with grief, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that bleſſed Character and Reward, of, <hi>Well done thou good and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, enter thou into thy Maſters joy.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. That to a pious and innocent Soul,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:103237:161"/>the conſideration of Death and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning again to a troubleſome and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life, is matter of great joy and comfort: <hi>VVhen a few years are come, then I ſhall go the way, whence I shall not return.</hi> This life is a life of trouble; we no ſooner enter into it, but we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence miſerable; the beſt part of it is Checkered with Sorrows, and when we leave it, it is not without pains and groans: So that the whole Series of it from the Cradle to the Grave, is nothing elſe but one Chain and Link of Miſery. This lot happens both to the good, and to the bad; to the juſt, and to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; and the latter as well as the former might ſeem to ſolace himſelf with the conſideration of the brevity of the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but yet the righteous and holy Man, as his troubles are far greater, having the addition of grief for his own and others Sins, the fears of Relapſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, the difficulty of conquering Temptations, and being faithful unto death: This enhanſes his ſorrow, and multiplies his troubles, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the conſideration of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Death and never returning more to ſo troubleſome and ſinful State of Life; muſt needs revive his Spirits,

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103237:164"/>and to receive his departing Breath. Thoſe Arms that uſed to hug and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace me at our firſt Meetings, are now become ſo weak and languid that he cannot ſhake hands at parting, nor lift them up unto his Maker, That Tongue that was formerly the Conduit of Eloquence, and Charm'd all that heard him (by its ſweet and melli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Expreſſions) into a ſenſible but ſilent admiration, is now become mute and ſpeechleſs, that he cannot as much as take his <hi>

                        <p>O conſider with thy ſelf that thou art made of the ſame Fleſh and Blood, mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the ſame Clay, and that this might have been thy preſent Condition

                        <p>O Immortal and Everliving Lord God, thy years endure throughout all Generations; from everlaſting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting thou art God. I thy frail Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, created at firſt (by thy power) to a ſtate of Immortality with thy ſelf, which by <hi>Adams</hi> Tranſgreſſion (the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative of all mankind) I have long ſince forfeited my right to, and am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come liable to Death. I acknowledg thy mercy towards me in my Creation, and thy juſtice and faithfulneſs in the execution of thy Threatnings, upon breach of the firſt Covenant. The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. Behold thou haſt now made my days as it were a ſpan length, and mine age is even as nothing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:103237:204"/>of thee, and I am altogether vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The ſentence of Death hath paſſed upon all; for that all have ſinned: And I who have had ſo great a ſhare in ſinning, cannot but expect to receive the due Wages of it, <hi>Death.</hi> Only I beſeech thee, bleſſed God. to make me wiſe now in the time of my Health and Srength, to underſtand this, and to conſider my latter end. Grant, O Lord, that by departing from every known ſin: by keeping Innocency, and always taking heed to the thing that is right, I may be in an habitual preparation for Death, and find peace at the laſt. Wean my heart daily more and more from the love of the World, and worldly things, and place my affections upon their right and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Objects, Heaven, and Heavenly things; that my heart may be where my Treaſure is; and that whenever I ſhall be called to part with them, I may leave all without any murmuring or reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and be willing and content to die. Let every pain and ſickneſs mind me of my laſt: And that Death may not be a ſurprize unto me, furniſh my Soul with all thoſe Graces before-hand, which I ſhall have greateſt occaſions to make uſe of in my laſt Conflict. Give me Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:103237:204"/>unto life, not to be repented of. A Stedfaſt Faith, that worketh by Love towards thee my God, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all the World: A Firm Hope, ſuch as maketh not aſhamed, but may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Anchor of my Soul, entring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven within the Vail: True Chriſtian Courage and Patience, and a reſolved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a cheerful ſubmiſſion to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Correction: And Grant that in all things I may ſo put my Soul, and Houſe in order, that when I come to die, I may have nothing elſe to do but to die.</p>
                        <p>Let not my Death be unexpected, untimely, or violent, if it be thy holy will: And when it ſhall pleaſe thee to caſt me on my laſt Bed, give me Grace to ſearch my Heart; to renew my Repentance and Intereſt in Jeſus; and to compoſe my Soul for God. Give me the opportunity and refreſhment of thy holy Sacrament (the Seal of the Divine Love) the benefit of Abſolution: Some irradiations of thy Love and Favour, in the aſſurances of pardon and peace, together with a patient and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expectation of the performance of all thy promiſes. Let not the Devil take advantage of my weakneſs, nor

Let not his Accuſations or my Sins di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract me in my laſt hour; but do thou interpoſe thy ſeaſonable Relief: O for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me not when my ſtrength faileth me, but in the mid'ſt of the ſorrows and temptations that I have upon my Bed, let thy Comforts refreſh my Soul. O ſuffer me not for any pains of death to fall from thee: And in my laſt Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, when my Soul ſhall quit the rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous habitation of my Body, let thy holy Angels convey it into the Regions of a glorious Eternity; where there ſhall be no more death, nor ſorrow, nor crying, nor pain.
